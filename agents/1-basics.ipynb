      "- Aim to eat a balanced meal 1.5 to 3 hours before exercising.\n",
      "- Include easily digestible carbohydrates for quick energy (e.g., oatmeal, banana, whole-grain toast).\n",
      "- Add a moderate amount of protein to support muscle function (e.g., yogurt, lean chicken, or a protein smoothie).\n",
      "- Avoid heavy, high-fat, or high-fiber foods right before exercise to reduce digestive discomfort.\n",
      "- If short on time, a small snack like a piece of fruit or a granola bar 30-60 minutes before the workout can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "**After a Workout:**\n",
      "- Focus on replenishing glycogen stores with carbohydrates (e.g., rice, potatoes, fruits).\n",
      "- Include protein to aid muscle repair and growth (e.g., eggs, whey protein, lean meat).\n",
      "- Aim to eat within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise to maximize recovery.\n",
      "- Stay hydrated by drinking water or an electrolyte beverage if you had an intense or long session.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Pre-Workout Snack:**\n",
      "- Banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Warm-up (3-4 minutes):**  \n",

      "- Arm circles and shoulder rolls  \n",

      "**2. Mobility & Stretching (5 minutes):**  \n",
      "- Cat-Cow stretch: Helps mobilize the spine gently.  \n",

      "- Hip Flexor Stretch: Sitting or kneeling stretch to relieve tight hip flexors common from sitting.  \n",
      "- Pelvic tilts: Helps engage core and stretch the lower back.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Strengthening (10 minutes):**  \n",
      "- Glute bridges (2 sets of 10-15 reps) – strengthen glutes to support lower back.  \n",
      "- Bird Dogs (2 sets of 10 reps per side) – enhance core and lower back stability.  \n",
      "- Planks (hold for 20-30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times) – build core strength.  \n",
      "- Wall sits or chair squats (2 sets of 10-15 reps) – strengthen legs and support posture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Cool-down (1-2 minutes):**  \n",
      "- Gentle stretches focusing on hamstrings, lower back, and shoulders.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional tips:  \n",
      "- Take short breaks from sitting during your workday. Stand up and stretch every 30-60 minutes.  \n",
      "- Maintain proper sitting posture with lumbar support if possible.  \n",
      "- Consider ergonomic adjustments at your workstation.  \n",
